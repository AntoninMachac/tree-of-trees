        <notes>  One of the most parsimonious trees from the unit-weighted analysis with the topology identical to the single most parsimonious tree from the successively reweighted analysis. 
		Familial classification according to results from this and previous studies (Olmstead and Reeves, 1995  ; Oxelman, Backlund, and Bremer, 1999  ). 
		Nodes with jackknife and bootstrap values >90% are indicated with thick lines. 
		Taxa indicated by dots have previously been assigned to Loganiaceae by Leeuwenberg and Leenhouts (1980)
