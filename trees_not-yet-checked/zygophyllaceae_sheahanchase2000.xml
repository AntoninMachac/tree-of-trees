        <notes> One of six equally parsimonious trees resulting from the rbcL analysis. This tree was identical in topology to the single SW tree: Fitch length 607 steps, CI = 0.58, RI = 0.82 (SW length 292.730, CI = 0.80, RI = 0.92). Fitch branch lengths are shown above the branches (ACCTRAN optimization). Numbers below the branches indicate the percentage bootstrap support in the SW and Fitch trees, respectively; branches with less than 50% are marked with a dash. 
		Branches not present in all of the six Fitch trees are marked with an arrow.</notes>
