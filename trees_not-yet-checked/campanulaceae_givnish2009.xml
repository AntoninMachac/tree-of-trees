        <notes> Relationships among Hawaiian lobeliads and allies ( psbA-trnH, trnL-trnF, rpl16, trnT-trnL, trnV-trnK, atpB-rbcL, rbcL
partial cds). Phylogram is one of two shortest trees arising from MP analysis of sequence and indel variation, using L. cardinalis
and L. vivaldii as out-groups; branch lengths are proportional to the inferred amounts of genetic change. This tree is identical in
topology to the parsimony jackknife tree and (except for the position of Isotoma) to the ML and BA trees based on nucleotide
characters only (see text); the open arrow indicates the node that collapses in the strict consensus of the two MP trees. Tree
lengthZ1393 steps under parsimony; consistency index CIZ0.86; CI0Z0.76; excluding autapomorphies. Jackknife support is
shown above each node; posterior probability is shown below (the single node that collapses in the BA tree has no such
probability shown). The Hawaiian lobeliads (green box) are monophyletic with 100% posterior probability.
