        <notes> Maximum likelihood tree based on ITS sequence data for Subtribe Artemisiinae (Asteraceae). With the exception of Nipponanthemum,
Leucanthemella, Cymbopappus, Pentzia and Oncosiphon, all outgroup genera used in analysis are not shown but are listed
in Table 1 (see additional file 1). Small segregate and allied genera of Artemisia s.l. are in bold. Subgeneric assignments for Artemisia
s.s. are indicated by colored boxes. All Artemisia species that are not placed in a colored box are members of subg. Artemisia
and primarily occur in the Old World. Numbers followed by '%' are bootstrap values derived from 100 bootstrap replicates
using parsimony criteria, and numbers followed by 'p' are posterior probabilities derived from Bayesian analysis using likelihood
criteria.</notes>
