        <notes> One of the highest-scoring likelihood trees under the GTR + G model for Cucurbitaceae obtained from combined chloroplast loci (matK, rbcL, the
trnL region, and rpl20-rps12), with parsimony bootstrap proportions shown above branches. Genera marked by an asterisk (*) were placed in Benincaseae
by Jeffrey (2005), but are placed differently here (Bambekea, Cogniauxia, Cucumeropsis, Eureiandra, Nothoalsomitra); genera marked by a cross (+)
(Ampelosicyos and Tricyclandra) were placed in Trichosantheae, but also are placed differently here. The bar at the base of Cucurbitaceae indicates the
gain of a 35-nt-long inversion in the tRNALeu-tRNAPhe intergenic spacer (compare Fig. 2); the X refers to two reversals of the inversion. Of the monotypic
genera obtained after this paper went to press, Cyclantheropsis parviflora is sister to Chalaema and Sicydium in the Zanonieae, and Pseudocyclanthera
australis is sister to Rytidostylis in the Sicyeae. The tribal classification follows Jeffrey (2005), and the black brackets refer to clades, the grey brackets to
grades.
