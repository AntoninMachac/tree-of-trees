        <notes>  Strict consensus of the 1 512 most parsimonious trees based on the combined data set of nucleotide substitutions from rbcL and matK
sequences from 48 taxa. Decay values (first) and bootstrap percentages (second) are mapped along each branch. Major groups discussed in the text
are bracketed and labeled (subfamily Hydrocotyloideae is abbreviated Hydro.). The grey branch (leading to Aralia and Panax) represents the
only additional clade to be resolved when matK indels were included in the data set as binary characters.
