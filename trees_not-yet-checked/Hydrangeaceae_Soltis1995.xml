        <notes>One of 18 shortest trees resulting from parsimony 
		analysis of rbcL sequences of Hydrangeaceae and other members 
		of the Cornaceous clade (length = 681 steps, 
		consistency index = 0.561, retention index = 0.692). 
		The tree is rooted using Diospyros, Sarracenia, Roridula, 
		and Fouquieria as outgroups (these taxa were chosen as outgroups
		based on the results of Chase et al., 1993 and Xiang et al., 1993).
		Numbers above the lines indicate the number of nucleotide 
		substitutions supporting each branch. Numbers in parentheses
		above the lines represent decay values. Bold numbers below 
		the lines indicate the percentage of occurrence of each 
		monophyletic group in the results of 100 bootstrap samples.
		Nodes that are not present in all shortest trees are indicated
		by black arrows.</notes>
