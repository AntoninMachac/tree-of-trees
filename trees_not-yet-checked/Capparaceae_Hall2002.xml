        <notes>One of 4499 most-parsimonious trees (randomly chosen) from analyses of the 55-taxa ndhF data set. Tropaeolum was designated as the outgroup.
The trees are 1255 steps long. Branch lengths are provided above each branch, and bootstrap percentages .50% are given below. Branches with bootstrap
support greater than 90% are in boldface type. Branches that collapse in the consensus tree are indicated with a dashed line. The four indels are indicated by
boxes; closed boxes indicate the three indels with a single origin and open boxes indicate the one indel requiring parallel or reversal events (Appendix 2,
http://ajbsupp.botany.org/v89/).</notes>
