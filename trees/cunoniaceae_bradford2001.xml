  <notes>Strict consensus tree (solid lines) from a parsimony analysis
    of morphological characters using a constraint tree (bold
    branches) based on clades found in molecular analyses. M labels
    those branches found in the strict consensus of an unconstrained
    analysis of morphology, with the clade of Weinmannia sections not
    resolved in the constrained analysis (dashed lines). DNA was
    unavailable for taxa in bold. Small arrows indicate nodes not seen
    in the strict consensus of molecular analyses. Tribes are in gray
    boxes, with a list of morphological synapomorphies indicated for
    each tribe. The form of flower-bearing axes is represented for
    each genus or clade. Pullea is polymorphic, and Anodo- petalum has
    solitary flowers or rarely 3-flowered cymes.
