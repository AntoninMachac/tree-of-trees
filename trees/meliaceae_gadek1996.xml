    Caption: "One of ten shortest trees found by PAUP (Swofford,
    1993), shown as a cladogram with branch lengths proportional to
    the number of unambiguous substitutions. Arrows indicate branches
    that collapse in the strict consensus. Decay values are shown
    below each branch. The five lineages identified within Sapindales
    are indicated by numbers in circles, in the order in which they
    are discussed in the texts." Notes: The branches mentioned as
    having arrows were collapsed in the newick file.  Only the
    "sp. nov." branch was pruned.
