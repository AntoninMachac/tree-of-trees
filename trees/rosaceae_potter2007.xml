  <notes>Caption: "Strict consensus of 226 most parsimonious trees (l
  = 9,682, ci = 0.5225 (0.4302 excluding autapomorphies), ri = 0.7112)
  from phylogenetic analysis of all data partitions except pgip and
  ppo. Bootstrap (above branches) and Bayesian clade credibility
  (below branches, in italics) support values are indicated. Arrows
  are used to indicate groups that were supported by the Bayesian
  analysis but were not recovered in the strict consensus tree. (In
  the Bayesian tree, the branching order within Spiraeoideae was:
  Lyonothamnus; Neillieae; (the branch leading to the remainder of the
  subfamily supported with 68% clade credibility), Kerriodae; (the
  branch leading to the remainder of the subfamily supported with 100%
  clade credibility), Amygdaleae; the rest of the subfamily)" Notes:
  The Rosoideae Subfamily was not included.  The Amygdaleae clade was
  collapsed. </notes>
