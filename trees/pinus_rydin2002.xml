  <notes>Caption: "Combined 4-gene analysis of rbcL, atpB, 18S, and
  26S; strict consensus of the shortest trees.  All character changes
  are included. Of 5923 characters, 2205 were phylogenetically
  informative. Jackknife values are above branches, branch support
  below." Notes: Newick file was adapted from TreeBASE file. Pinus was
  plucked from a larger tree, and hybrid species were pruned.</notes>
