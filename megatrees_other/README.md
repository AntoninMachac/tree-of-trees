2013-11-17 : Hong Qian pointed out on 2013-08-22 that the existing
`davies2004.bl.new` had discrepancies in the ages of three taxa
Ebenaceae, Potamogetonaceae, and Ruppiaceae with the data published in
the original paper.  I have replaced the existing `davies2004.bl.new`
file with the file at
<http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/davies/Data/Dated%20tree%20Ultrametric.phy>. I
think the discrepancy must have come from the original version being
an out put of `bladj` (using Davies’ node ages) on Davies’ cladogram,
and not the actual ultrametric tree provided on his website. Apologies
for any problems that masy have causes.  Cam
